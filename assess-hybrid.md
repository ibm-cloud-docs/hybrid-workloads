# Assessing your current applications
{: #assess-hybrid}

Assessing current applications is a critical first step in your hybrid cloud and application modernization journey. It provides a clear understanding of the existing landscape and helps identify the best path forward for each application.

1. Catalog all hardware, software, network components, and dependencies involved in the current infrastructure.
1. Understand how applications interact with the infrastructure, including load balancing, networking, security, and storage configurations.
1. Plan how containerized applications will interact with non-containerized legacy systems.

Inventory and categorize
- inventory of all your existing applications
- categorizing gives you a breakdown of your application landscape so you can start making some decisions about where to focus your efforts

Classify applications for modernization
- Cloud ready
- Requires refactoring - containerization
- Keep on-prem
