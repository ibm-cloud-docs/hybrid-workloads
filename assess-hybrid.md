# Assessing your current applications
{: #assess-hybrid}

Assessing current applications is a critical first step in your hybrid cloud and application modernization journey. It provides a clear understanding of the existing landscape and helps identify the best path forward for each application to mximize the value of your hybrid cloud investment.

1. Catalog all hardware, software, network components, and dependencies involved in your current infrastructure.
1. Understand how applications interact with the infrastructure, including networking, security, and storage configurations.
1. Plan how containerized applications will interact with non-containerized legacy systems.
1. Classify applications for modernization
   - Cloud ready
   - Requires refactoring - containerization
   - Keep on-prem
