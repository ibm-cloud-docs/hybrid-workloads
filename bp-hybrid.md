# Hybrid cloud management
{: #bp-hybrid}

Review the following best practices for hybrid cloud management that can help ensure efficiency, security, and scalability across on-premises and cloud environments.
{: shortdesc}



## Leveraging cloud native services
{: #cloud-native}

Use cloud native services that are designed for hybrid architectures, like {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} for unified management across environments, {{site.data.keyword.cpd_full_notm}} for integrated data management, and {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} for the flexibility to deploy workloads to the cloud or on-premises.

## Supporting multi-cloud
{: #multi-cloud}

Prioritize an infrastructure that supports integration with multiple cloud providers. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports a multi-cloud strategy with {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}}, which allows consistent management across different clouds.

## Managing hybrid access
{: #hybrid-access}

Ensure that security policies are consistent across all environments by using IAM solutions that span on-premises and cloud resources.

## Unifying monitoring and management
{: #unify-hybrid}

Use a single platform to monitor and manage resources across on-premises and cloud environments. Use tools like {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}}, which provides centralized management, monitoring, and control for hybrid environments.

## Optimizing workloads
{: #optimize-workloads}

Monitor usage patterns and optimize workloads for performance and cost. Use [cost analysis](/docs/hybrid-workloads?topic=hybrid-workloads-viewingusage&interface=ui) to analyze spending and identify inefficiencies. Classify and place workloads based on their requirements, like latency, data residency, compliance, or performance.
