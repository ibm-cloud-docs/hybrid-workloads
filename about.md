## What is hybrid cloud?
{: #why-hybrid}

Hybrid cloud is a model that combines the use of public cloud services and on-premises infrastructure. The public cloud is hosted off-premises in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} data center locations while on-premises infrastructure runs on site at your location.

A hybrid strategy gives you the flexibility to run workloads in the appropriate environment based on cost, performance, and regulatory requirements. For example, you might use a public cloud for variable workloads that require rapid scaling and run predictable workloads on-premises.



### On-premises
{: #on-prem}

On-premises refers to computing resources and infrastructure that are physically located within an organization's own facilities, such as a data center or servers, storage devices and networking hardware.

On-premises solutions are often used for critical applications, sensitive data, or in industries with strict compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Off-premises
{: #off-prem}

Off-premises refers to computing resources that are hosted and managed outside of an organization's physical location. This typically includes cloud services that are provided by a third-party like {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Off-premises solutions are commonly used for web applications, storage, disaster recovery, and workloads that require elasticity and scalability.
