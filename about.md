## What is hybrid cloud?
{: #why-hybrid}

Hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that integrates on-premises data centers and public cloud services. By integrating private and public resources, you can share data and applications between both environments to create a unified, flexible, and optimized computing environment.

A hybrid strategy gives you the flexibilty to run workloads in the appopriate environment based on cost, performance, and regulatory requirements. For example, you might leverage a public cloud to scale resources while maintaining critical workloads on-premises. This way, you can meet security and compliance requirements by keeping sensitive data on-premises and use the public cloud for less sensitive workloads.


### Public Cloud
{: #public cloud}

A public cloud is a cloud computing environment where resources are shared among multiple organizations. It is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider who offers computing resources, such as servers and storage, over the internet.

### Private cloud
{: #private-cloud}

A private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. It offers similar benefits to a public cloud, such as scalability and self-service, but is operated solely for that organization. You can have a private cloud that is on-premises or off-premises. For example, this setup can be hosted in a dedicated section of a third-party data center or on-premises through managed services like IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud.

### On-premises
{: #on-prem}

On-premises refers to computing resources and infrastructure that are physically located within an organization's own facilities, such as a data center or servers, storage devices and networking hardware.

On-premises solutions are often used for critical applications, sensitive data, or in industries with strict compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Off-premises
{: #off-prem}

Off-premises refers to computing resources that are hosted and managed outside of an organization's physical location. This typically includes cloud services provided by third-party vendors.

Off-premises solutions are commonly used for web applications, storage, disaster recovery, and workloads that require elasticity and scalability.
