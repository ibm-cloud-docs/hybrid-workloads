## What is hybrid cloud?
{: #why-hybrid}

Hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that integrates on-premises data centers and public cloud services. By integrating private and public resources, you can share data and applications between both environments to create a unified, flexible, and optimized computing environment.

A hybrid strategy gives you the flexibilty to run workloads in the appopriate environment based on cost, performance, and regulatory requirements. For example, you might leverage a public cloud to scale resources while maintaining critical workloads on-premises. This way, you can meet security and compliance requirements by keeping sensitive data on-premises and use the public cloud for less sensitive workloads.

Managing workloads in hybrid environments allows you to leverage the best of both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. This approach provides greater flexibility and scalability compared to a single public or private cloud solution.

You might have a hybrid setup, but is it truly optimized? With {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}}, you can manage all of your environments through a single pane of glass.
