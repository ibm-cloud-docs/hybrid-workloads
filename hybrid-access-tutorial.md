# Customizing access for accounts with hybrid workloads
{: #access-tutorial-hybrid}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="60m"}

Customize how users with different job roles can view and access an account with hybrid workloads. In this scenario, a retail company wants to run their core business logic on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} on-premises and run front-end services on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. There are separate job roles for the team that manages the underlying infrastructure and the team that deploys applications to run on the infrastructure.



The roles of an IT infrastructure engineer and a developer are distinct. They might interact with the same resources for different purposes within the same account. However, a developer usually only interacts with the infrastructure through automation for testing their code. Create separate trusted profiles for the IT infrastructure engineer, the development team, and the automation service. Assign each profile the access that they need and customize their platform experience to do their job.

## Before you begin
{: #before-hybrid}

Make sure that you are logged in as the account owner or a user with the Administrator role on all account management services or Administrator role on the IAM Identity Service. For more information, see [IAM Identity service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#identity-service-account-management).

## Create a trusted prolfile: IT infrastructure engineer
{: #it-tp}
{: step}

The primary focus of the IT infrastructure engineer is helping ensure that the underlying infrastructure, both cloud and on-premises, runs smoothly, is secure, scalable, and available for other teams, like development.

To set up {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud and [manage {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instances](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-modifying-instance), the IT infrastructure engineer needs the following roles and services:
- Administrator and Manager on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
- Administrator on {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}}
- Administrator on {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}}

To optimize and monitor resources once the infrastructure is in place, the IT infrastructure engineer needs the following roles and services:
- Administrator on monitoring tools and logs (Administator on X service)
- Administrator on compute resources

Complete the following steps:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM) > Trusted profiles** and click **Create**.
1. Enter the profile name `IT infrastructure` and the initials `IT`.
1. Enter a description for the profile, like ""
1. Select a color to represent this trusted profile and click **Continue**. Your users might have access to multiple trusted profiles in multiple accounts.
1. Select **Individual users** and the IT infrastructure engineers that need access. Then, click **Add to profile**.
1. Click **Continue** and select **Access policy**.


## Create a trusted prolfile: Develpoer
{: #dev-tp}
{: step}

The primary focus of the developer is building, testing, and deploying the retail applications that run on the infrastructure set up by the IT infrastructure engineer.

To containerize, deploy, and scale applications on Kubernetes clusted running on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, the developers need the following rolse and service:
- Writer on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
- Writer on Kubernetes
- Writer on CI/CD pipelines

Complete the following steps:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM) > Trusted profiles** and click **Create**.
1. Enter the profile name `IT infrastructure` and the initials `IT`.
1. Enter a description for the profile, like ""
1. Select a color to represent this trusted profile and click **Continue**. Your users might have access to multiple trusted profiles in multiple accounts.
1. Select **Individual users** and the IT infrastructure engineers that need access. Then, click **Add to profile**.
1. Click **Continue** and select **Access policy**.



## Create a trusted prolfile: Automation service
